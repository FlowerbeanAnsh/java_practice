          Stack
          <---->

 --> Linear data structure
 --> operation can only be performed on the head

  1)insert - push
  2)delete - pop
  3) peak operation-- fetching what node is stored at the head(top) of a stack.

 Important points:
 i) Modification is only possible on only top
 ii) size ids fixed as array


 ---->      Stack using Array   <-----

 top variable ---> stores the index of top[0,size-1]
   push(45) --> array[top] =45   //example
   top = top + 1  // to reach to next index
   --> if size is not left and we can not add more nodes then
   this problem is called as "overflow".

   ---->  Stack using LinkedList    <----

   All operations possible on last

   "stack underflow" --
